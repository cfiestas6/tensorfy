### Custom RPC
When a user interacts with a dApp, that transaction is intercepted by our custom RPC, which simulates the transaction.
### Large Language Model
The transaction execution simulation results are sent to a LLM, which translates complex blockchain interactions into natural language.
### ArgentX Wallet Integration
Integrated with ArgentX, the explained transaction details are displayed on the user's wallet.
